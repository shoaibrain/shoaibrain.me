description: A self hosted data pipeline that scrapes, transforms, and serves
---

My objective with this project is to make publically available data like [data.gov](https://data.gov/) accessible, explorable
and documentable by users through web application interface.

This is a data pipeline using [Spring Cloud Data Flow] (https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-dataflow) to consume data from an HTTP endpoint
and write the payload to a Cassandra database.

Extract -> Transform -> Load

1. Extract: HTTP endpoint
2. Transform: Spring Cloud Data Flow
3. Load: Cassandra
