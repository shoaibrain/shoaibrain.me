#### NetApp

Software Engineer, Aug 2021 - Dec 2022

[NetApp](https://www.netapp.com/) is an intelligent data infrastructure company that provides unified data storage,
integrated data services, and cloud operations solutions to enterprise customers. I worked
on two projects during my time at NetApp.

- In 2022, I developed a documentation framework using Java and Spring Boot to
  automate the reporting of product features in [CloudInsights](https://www.netapp.com/cloud-services/cloud-insights/).
  This work cut down the manual task by over 90% and increased the accuracy of the reports significantly.

- In 2021, I worked on revamping our system insights & software operation dashboard,
  with Javascript, HTML, React and Tailwind CSS enabling faster development iterations,
  easing maintenance, & ensured a consistent and responsive design across the app.

#### Panasonic Automotive

DevOps Engineer, March 2021 â€” June 2021

[Panasonic Automotive](https://na.panasonic.com/us/industries/automotive) is a leading global
supplier of automotive infotainment and connectivity system solutions. I joined DevOps team as a contractor to help with their CI/CD pipelines & setting
up kafka data-stream infrastructure.

During my time there, I managed Jenkins CI/CD pipelines through
regular analysis, forecasting, and custom Jenkins plugins.
I also collabrated with the team & assisted in locating data sources, destination & communication patterns
within the infrastructure to aid in setting up kafka data-stream.

#### University of Texas at Arlington

Web Developer, Nov, 2020 - Jul, 2021

Provost office at UT Arlington has a mission of promoting and achieving academic excellence and student success.

During my time, I used Sitecore Content Management System (CMS) to build over 100 webpages

I also conducted data aggregation from Academic, Enrollment, and Financial data.
Performed data analysis using Python and SQL automation to produce insightful reports
