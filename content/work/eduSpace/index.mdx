  An initial highlevel design of eduSpace. This architecture is subject to
  change as I progress with the project. [eduSpace

</Callout>

This design approach lies on the extreme where all tenants/users will share all the
components. Although this tenant model is attractive for its simplicity and less expensive to
run, this design has lots of limitations.

## Project Scope & Goals

When it comes to developing a software, design is a very important factor.
The design and architecture of a software should not only be scalable but also easy for
developers to understand and contribute to. The architecture should allow for easy, incremental
changes and should be able to adapt to new requirements.

I've devided to go with [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) as it provides a lot of features out of the box.
From scaling to routing, developer experience, Next.js has it all. And this allows me to focus on the
software product & business logic itself rather than the infrastructure.

In the first series of this project, I'll be focusing on building the core features of the software.
For starter, these features will focus on four main entities in any hypothetical school system.

1. Students
2. Teachers
3. Guardians
4. ClassGrades

To keep things simple, I'm starting with these four entities. The user
of eduSpace will be able to manage students, teachers, guardians and class grades.
