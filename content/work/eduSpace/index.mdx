I got the inspiration to work on this particular project from my dad.
To give little context, my dad runs a private boarding [school](https://www.facebook.com/S.S.E.B.S.M.H/) in Nepal.
After having a brief conversation with him,
I learned school management software is not accessible to most of the schools in Nepal.
eduSpace is my attempt to solve this problem.
