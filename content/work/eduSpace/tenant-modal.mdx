title: Modeling Tenant for eduSpace
description: overview of tenant model in a school management Application
---

There're several parts to consider while designing a multi-tenant systems for schools.
Intending to share some of the resources among the tenants, while also providing a
considerable level of isolation between them. These are the some of the requirements
and considration to pay attention to:

- How's multi-tenancy deployed on Vercel, and how to manage the tenants?
- Application customization for tenants
- How will you monitor, manage, automate, scale, and govern your Vercel environment,
  and how will multitenancy impact this?
- Which components of eduSpace handles tenant onboarding and management,
  and how should these components be designed?
- Be mindful of customers' requirements for regulatory compliance, the isolation of their data,
  and ensuring that you meet a specified service-level objective (SLO), like uptime or service availability.

## Business to business (B2B)

eduSpace customers are other organizations. Tenant is mapped to those organizations.
Customers have different divisions (team or department) and they could have presenece in
different countries/regions. A single Tenant will have multiple users. These users are
Teachers, Student, Parents, and Admins etc.

## Tenant isolation

A full multi-tenant deployment where every components are shared among the tenant.

#### Challenges

- address concerns about the effects that individual tenants can have on the overall system.
- figure out way to track & associate Vercel cost with each tenant.
- how to handle maintainance and upgrades of the system. How does this model affect the
  ability to upgrade the system?
- scale?

## Tenant lifecycle

- Trial tenants
- Onboard new tenants
- Upgrade tenant's infrastructure
- Offboard tenants
- Deactivate and reactivate tenants
