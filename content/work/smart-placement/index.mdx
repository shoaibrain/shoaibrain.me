title: Smart Placement
description: A self hosted reactjs web application to streamline students placement
---

## Project Initiative

The School of Social Work at the University of Texas at Arlington [UTA](https://www.uta.edu/) aims to streamline the student placement process for accumulating extra-curricular,
volunteer, and internship credits essential for graduation. In response to this need, a self-hosted web application, **Smart Placement** has been developed.
This application facilitates the placement of students into agencies, ensuring a seamless process that allows users, including administrators, students, web advisors,
and agencies, to efficiently complete tasks with minimal clicks. The ultimate goal is to provide a user-friendly platform that enables individuals to easily fulfill
degree requirements while contributing to their academic and professional development. Once the project is completed, ownership and management of 'Smart Placement'
will be transferred to the College of Social Work at UTA, as they are the sponsoring entity.

**Smart Placement** serves as a comprehensive solution tailored to the specific requirements of the College of Social Work, offering a centralized platform to
manage student placements and associated credits. By providing a user-centric experience, the web application aims to enhance the efficiency of administrative
tasks related to student placement. Following project completion, the College of Social Work will have the autonomy to utilize and administer **Smart Placement**
according to their unique needs and preferences. This initiative underscores a collaborative effort to support students in their academic journey and highlights
the commitment of the College of Social Work to foster a conducive environment for student success and engagement.
