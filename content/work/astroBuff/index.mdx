description: An android application built in Android Studio that retrieves & serves various data from Open APIs

## Project Description

During my final year of undergrad, I took a course called "Software Product Management", where we dived deep into the process
of planing, designing, and developing a software product from scratch using the [Agile methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development). In this course, I proved my ability of leadership, work in a team, and learned
how to carry out the entire process of software development, from the initial planning phase to the final deployment phase.

I led a team of 4 students (including myself) to develop an Android application that retrieves astronomical data from open resources,
and serves to the user in an interesting and interactive way.

## Technologies Used

- Java as an application programming language
- Android Studio as the IDE
- Git for version control
- GitHub for hosting the repository
- Notion for project management
- Google Drive for file sharing
- Microsoft Teams for meetings

## Core Features

- A built in notification system based on the user's location, that notifies the user when the ISS is passing over their location.
- Serve the user with the astronomical picture of the day, along with fun facts and a quiz to make app more fun & educational.
- User can view the current location of the ISS on a map within AstroBuff app.
- Source astronomical news & events from NASA's RSS feed and serve them to the user within the app.
