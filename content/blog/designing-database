## Introduction

A database design is mostly dictated by the business and functional requirements of the application.

School mainly consist of the following entities:

1. Student
2. Employee
3. Guardian
4. GradeLevel

Here, I'm creating a schema for school database.

Here's what a schema using prisma would look like.

```js

model SchoolYear {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  name      String
  startDate DateTime
  endDate   DateTime
  ...
}

model GradeLevel {
  id            String
  name          String
  description   String?
  ...
}

```

## There are other elements we need to style

I almost forgot to mention links, like [this link to the Tailwind CSS website](https://tailwindcss.com). We almost made them blue but that's so yesterday, so we went with dark gray, feels edgier.

We even included table styles, check it out:

| Wrestler                | Origin       | Finisher           |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Bret "The Hitman" Hart  | Calgary, AB  | Sharpshooter       |
| Stone Cold Steve Austin | Austin, TX   | Stone Cold Stunner |
| Randy Savage            | Sarasota, FL | Elbow Drop         |
| Vader                   | Boulder, CO  | Vader Bomb         |
| Razor Ramon             | Chuluota, FL | Razor's Edge       |

We also need to make sure inline code looks good, like if I wanted to talk about `<span>` elements or tell you the good news about `@tailwindcss/typography`.
