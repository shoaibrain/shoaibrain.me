## Getting fundamentals right

for me 2023 was as crazy as it could possibly be. with $$$ in college debt, and no
job, it has all been a hustle. if anything, i learned more about myself.

i've complied a little list for myself as a reminder for what
really matters. i strive to be more competent, and kind. i thank god and
everyone i've interacted.

1. pray
2. work hard by default
3. embrace the change
4. adaptability is a requirement for life
5. thereâ€™ll only be more sh\*t to deal with over time
6. be someone who provides
7. take more risks
